Fastorika Limited is committed to complying with international standards, including the FATF Recommendations, EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives (4AMLD, 5AMLD, 6AMLD), GDPR, and the relevant legislation of Belize and other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The objective of this Policy is to establish clear standards and internal procedures for customer due diligence (CDD), enhanced due diligence (EDD), ongoing monitoring, record-keeping, and reporting of suspicious activities to the competent authorities.<br/><br/>2. Regulatory Framework<br/>This Policy is based on the following legal and regulatory frameworks:<br/>- Financial Action Task Force (FATF) 40 Recommendations<br/>- EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives (4AMLD, 5AMLD, 6AMLD)<br/>- GDPR (data protection obligations)<br/>- Belize Anti-Money Laundering legislation<br/>- Other local AML/CFT laws applicable to the jurisdictions where Fastorika operates<br/><br/>3. Scope<br/><br/>This Policy applies to all employees, directors, contractors, and partners of Fastorika Limited. It covers all services, transactions, and business activities of the Company, including IT solutions, platform services, and any financial integrations.<br/>4. Risk-Based Approach<br/><br/>The Company adopts a risk-based approach to AML/CFT. Clients and transactions are classified into risk categories:<br/>- Low Risk<br/>- Medium Risk<br/>- High Risk (e.g., PEPs, large transactions, offshore jurisdictions)<br/><br/>Risk factors include geographical risk, product risk, client type, and transaction nature.<br/><br/>5. Customer Due D diligence (CDD/KYC)<br/>Fastorika Limited performs the following measures:<br/>- Customer identification (full name, DOB, citizenship, address, document)<br/>- Document authenticity verification<br/>- Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) for high-risk clients<br/>- Source of Funds (SoF) and Source of Wealth (SoW) verification<br/>- Ongoing monitoring of client operations<br/><br/>6. Politically Exposed Persons (PEP)<br/>The Company applies enhanced due diligence to all identified PEPs. Specialized databases and systems are used for detection.<br/><br/>7. Sanctions and Prohibited Activities<br/>Fastorika Limited screens all clients against international sanctions lists (UN, EU, OFAC, UK). The Company does not accept clients from high-risk FATF jurisdictions or those involved in prohibited activities.<br/>8. Transaction Monitoring<br/><br/>The Company monitors all transactions using automated and manual tools. Alerts are generated for suspicious operations, including structuring, smurfing, and other schemes (TBFC).<br/>9. Reporting Suspicious Operations<br/>Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR/STR) are submitted to competent authorities in Belize (FIU Belize) or the jurisdiction of operation. Reports are filed immediately upon detecting suspicious activity.<br/><br/>10. Data Storage<br/>Client documents, transaction history, and KYC files are stored for at least 5 years after the end of business relations. In some cases, up to 10 years per legislation.<br/><br/>11. Employee Training<br/>All Fastorika Limited employees must undergo annual AML training covering suspicious transaction identification, KYC procedures, and reporting duties.<br/><br/>12. Internal Control<br/>Fastorika Limited appoints a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) responsible for AML compliance, regulator reporting, and internal process oversight.<br/><br/>13. Liability for Violations<br/>Violations of this Policy result in disciplinary measures, up to termination of employment/cooperation, and reporting to authorities.<br/>",
