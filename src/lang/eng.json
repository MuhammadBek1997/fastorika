  "privacytitle":"Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Policy",
  "privacy": "1. Introduction<br/>This Policy sets out the framework adopted by Fastorika Limited (“the Company”) to prevent its services from being used for money laundering (ML) or terrorist financing (TF) purposes. Fastorika Limited is committed to complying with international standards, including the FATF Recommendations, EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives (4AMLD, 5AMLD, 6AMLD), GDPR, and the relevant legislation of Belize and other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The objective of this Policy is to establish clear standards and internal procedures for customer due diligence (CDD), enhanced due diligence (EDD), ongoing monitoring, record-keeping, and reporting of suspicious activities to the competent authorities.<br/><br/>2. Regulatory Framework<br/>This Policy is based on the following legal and regulatory frameworks:<br/>- Financial Action Task Force (FATF) 40 Recommendations<br/>- EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives (4AMLD, 5AMLD, 6AMLD)<br/>- GDPR (data protection obligations)<br/>- Belize Anti-Money Laundering legislation<br/>- Other local AML/CFT laws applicable to the jurisdictions where Fastorika operates<br/><br/>3. Scope<br/>This Policy applies to all employees, directors, contractors, and partners of Fastorika Limited. It covers all services, transactions, and business activities of the Company, including IT solutions, platform services, and any financial-related integrations.<br/><br/>4. Risk-Based Approach<br/>The Company adopts a risk-based approach to AML/CFT. Clients and transactions are classified into risk categories:<br/>- Low Risk<br/>- Medium Risk<br/>- High Risk (e.g., PEPs, high-value transactions, offshore jurisdictions)<br/><br/>Risk factors include geographical risk, product/service risk, client type, and transaction patterns.<br/><br/>5. Customer Due Diligence (CDD/KYC)<br/>Fastorika Limited performs the following measures:<br/>- Identification of customers (name, DOB, nationality, address, valid ID)<br/>- Verification of identity documents<br/>- Enhanced Due Diligence for high-risk clients<br/>- Verification of Source of Funds (SoF) and Source of Wealth (SoW)<br/>- Ongoing monitoring of client activities<br/><br/>6. Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)<br/>The Company applies Enhanced Due Diligence to all identified PEPs. Screening tools and databases are used to detect PEPs, their family members, and close associates.<br/><br/>7. Sanctions & Prohibited Activities<br/>Fastorika Limited screens all customers against international sanctions lists (UN, EU, OFAC, UK). The Company does not onboard clients from FATF high-risk jurisdictions or clients involved in prohibited activities.<br/><br/>8. Transaction Monitoring<br/>The Company monitors all transactions using automated and manual tools. Alerts are generated for unusual or suspicious activities, including structuring, smurfing, and transaction-based financial crimes (TBFC).<br/>9. Reporting<br/><br/>Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) are filed with the competent authority in Belize (FIU Belize) or in the jurisdiction of operation. Reports must be submitted immediately upon detection of suspicious activity.<br/>10. Record Keeping<br/><br/>Customer records, transaction history, and KYC documentation are kept for a minimum of 5 years after the end of the business relationship. In some cases, data may be retained for up to 10 years as required by law.<br/>11. Training & Awareness<br/><br/>All employees of Fastorika Limited must undergo AML training at least once a year. Training covers identification of suspicious transactions, KYC procedures, and reporting obligations.<br/>12. Internal Controls<br/><br/>Fastorika Limited appoints a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) responsible for AML compliance, reporting to regulators, and overseeing internal monitoring systems.<br/><br/>13. Enforcement<br/>Failure to comply with this Policy will result in disciplinary actions, which may include termination of employment or cooperation, and reporting to relevant authorities.<br/>",
